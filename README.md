# Neumorphism-Social-Icons

Neumorphism is a design trend that has created rifts in the world of UI. Someone claims that it is not intuitive for the user and takes away clarity, some others say that it can help to have clearer and more linear deisgns. I am of the opinion that if well done, in the right context, and accompanied by other elements that break its continuity, it can be an excellent resource to add charm to your website.
